# leaflet-challenge
----------------------------
In this challenege I used The United States Geological Survey, and it's provided scientific data from the new set of tools they developed. To create a visual from the massive data they collected to allow them to inform the public and other government orginzations in hopes to secure funding on issues facing our planet. 

I used VS Code text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files, The Web browser Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug my visualizations, Git Bash interface to run a local server, And GitHub to deploy my final data visualization on GitHub Pages.
